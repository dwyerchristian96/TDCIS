NAME
      Real-Time Truncated Configuration Interaction Time Evolution Calculator
SYNOPSIS
      Propagates a truncated configuration interaction wavefunction in time
      using specified initial conditions.
USAGE
      TDCIS [-f <matrix_file>] [--print-level <print_level>] [--sub-levels substitutions] 
        [--intial-cond weight_vector] [--time-step time_step] [--steps steps] [--help]
OPTIONS
      -f matrix_file                   Input matrix file with initial set of molecular orbitals.

      --print-level print_level        Verbosity of output. Default print level is 1. Options
                                       0-4.

      --sub-levels substitutions       Substitution levels permitted in truncated CI calculation. 

      --initial-cond weight_vector     Initial state for simulation. For a pure state, the  
                                       desired root can be input as a single integer. For a 
                                       mixed state, each non-zero weighted root should be 
                                       included along wih the specified weight (Default is
                                       a ground state population of 1.0).  
                                   
                                       Example: [1,0.5:2,0.5] specifies an initial state with 
                                       50% weight on the lowest root and 50% weight on the 
                                       fourth root.

      --time-step time_step            Time step for simulation (default 0.1 au).

      --steps steps                    Number of steps to include in the calculation (default is 1000). 

      --help                           Output help documentation to terminal.

NOTES
      Compilation of this program requires the MQC library (https://github.com/MQCPack/mqcPack)
      and the gauopen utility (http://gaussian.com/g16/gauopen.zip) and compilation with the
      f08 standard.

      Compilation tested using: gfortran 9.2.0

      Note that subroutine Wr_LCBuf needs modifying in gauopen/qcmatrix.F as follows:
        line 58:       LenBX = (LenBuf/(2*abs(NR)))*abs(NR)
        line 60:       Call Wr_CBuf(IU,NTot*abs(NR),LenBX,X)

      Documentation generated with robodoc. To update documentation edit robodoc.rc to
      determine documentation output type and then run robodoc at the command line in the
      main directory.
